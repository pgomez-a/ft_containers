Once we've done CPP_Piscine, we're ready to step into the world of OOP. Our next big step will be to implement some of the most used STL containers, so we are going to work directly with our beloved templates as we discover their great potential. So far, we only know what a vector is but ... how does it work? How is it implemented? How do you manage memory allocation? How does a stack encapsulate its elements so that only a few member functions can be used? How do iterators work? All these questions, and many more, will be discovered and understood with ft_containers.
