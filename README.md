Once we've done CPP_Piscine, we're ready to step into the world of OOP. Our next big step will be to implement some of the most used **STL containers**, so we are going to work directly with our beloved templates as we discover their great potential. So far, we only know what a vector is but ... **how does it work? How is it implemented? How do you manage memory allocation? How does a stack encapsulate its elements so that only a few member functions can be used? How do iterators work? All these questions, and many more, will be discovered and understood with ft_containers.**<br>

Since most of the things that we implement with this project are part of the STL, this time I will give you the manual references that I have used to make this project. I think you will find them much more useful than the notes I usually make, since in this case they would be an identical copy of all the information found on those pages. **The reference manuals used are:**
- **[Cplusplus](https://www.cplusplus.com)**
- **[Cppreference](https://cppreference.com)**

<hr>

However, what I have done is create some images that show the main characteristics of each container. I hope you find them useful!
